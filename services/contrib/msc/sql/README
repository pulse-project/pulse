This directory contains every material needed to create the database
required by the MSC module to store its commands.

As the MSC evolve, so does the MSC database. This directory contains the
base schema (schema.sql) and subsequents evolutions (schema.sql.v.x).

To obtain a state-of-the-art MSC database, here is how to proceed:

1) create a new database called "msc":
    mysqladmin create msc

2) inject the base schema:
    mysql msc < schema.sql

3) inject evolutions:
    mysql msc < schema.sql.v.2
    mysql msc < schema.sql.v.3
    ...

4) create a new user with relevant privileges:
    mysql msc <<EOF
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON msc.* TO 'msc'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'msc' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES
EOF

5) update your /etc/mmc/plugins/msc.ini

6) enjoy !
